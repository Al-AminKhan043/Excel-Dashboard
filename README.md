# Data Analysis and Interactive Dashboard in Excel

Welcome to my project repository! This project demonstrates my skills in Excel data analysis, creating dynamic dashboards, and utilizing advanced features such as pivot tables, slicers, and various chart types.

## Project Overview

This project contains an **Excel file** with an interactive, fully responsive dashboard that visualizes data from a provided dataset. The dashboard is linked to pivot tables, making it dynamic and easy to analyze different aspects of the data. Iâ€™ve incorporated slicers for user navigation, allowing quick filtering of relevant information.

The project also includes a **Word file** with the task requirements that needed to be completed, outlining the steps followed during the analysis.

### Key Features

- **Interactive Dashboard**: A fully responsive and user-friendly dashboard with real-time updates based on user inputs.
- **Pivot Tables**: Dynamically linked pivot tables allow for flexible data analysis and summarization.
- **Slicers**: Interactive slicers enable users to filter and navigate through the data with ease.
- **Visualizations**: A variety of graphs and charts to represent the data, including bar charts, line graphs, pie charts, and more.
- **Dynamic Filtering**: Data can be filtered and sorted in real time, offering a seamless experience for analysis.

### Tools & Technologies Used

- **Microsoft Excel**: Pivot tables, slicers, and advanced charting features
- **Microsoft Word**: Task documentation and project outline

## Project Files

1. **Excel File**: Contains the dataset, pivot tables, slicers, and the interactive dashboard.
2. **Word File**: Includes the task details, analysis instructions, and steps for completion.

## Installation and Setup

1. Download the **Excel file** and **Word file** from the repository.
2. Open the Excel file in Microsoft Excel.
3. Use the slicers and interact with the dashboard to explore the data.
4. Review the Word file to understand the tasks completed and methodology used.

## How to Use the Dashboard

1. **Slicers**: Click on the slicers to filter the data based on different categories. The dashboard will update dynamically.
2. **Charts**: Interact with the charts and graphs to gain insights from the data. Hover over the elements for additional information.
3. **Pivot Tables**: Explore different summarized views of the dataset using the pivot tables in the Excel sheet.

## Project Insights

- This dashboard provides a comprehensive view of the dataset, showcasing key trends and patterns.
- The dynamic nature of the pivot tables and slicers allows users to dive deep into specific data points.
